My (public) science work.

Reminder to self: [Statistical Retrinking](http://xcelab.net/rm/statistical-rethinking) by Richard McElreath appears to become an awesome statistics book!

Luke Harmon sent me his excellent presentation he gave at 
a minisymposium for the thesis defence of Thijs Janzen. You
can get the PDF [here](Harmon2015/groningen_harmon_2015.pdf).

I replicated the likelihood calculations by Nee at al. (1994) in R
and created a nice PDF to accompany it.

Worked on coalescent theory and nicely document.

Thanks Wikipedia for this [list of mathematical operators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_mathematical_symbols_by_subject)!

I worked hard to replicate the likelihood calculations by Nee at al. (1994) and put my calculations in the folder NeeEtAl1994. I ended up using the likelihood functions of the DDD (Etienne & Haegeman) and LASER (Rabosky & Schliep) packages. Unsurprisingly, they give the same results (note that DDD uses a proxy for the likelihood, instead of the true likelihood). The expoTree package, however, I could not put it to good use.

Freek de Haas allowed me to put his, IMHO, excellent presentation online. It is [here (.ODP)](Presentations/FreekDeHaas2015ModelingMacroEvolutionaryProcesses.odp).

I'd love to have a section called 'Biology' here
