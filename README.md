My (public) science work.

I worked hard to replicate the likelihood calculations by Nee at al. (1994) and put my calculations in the folder NeeEtAl1994. I ended up using the likelihood functions of the DDD (Etienne & Haegeman) and LASER (Rabosky & Schliep) packages. Unsurprisingly, they give the same results. The expoTree package, however, I could not put it to good use.

Freek de Haas allowed me to put his, IMHO, excellent presentation online. It is [here (.ODP)](Presentations/FreekDeHaas2015ModelingMacroEvolutionaryProcesses.odp).

I'd love to have a section called 'Biology' here
