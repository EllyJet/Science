	abstract = {Habitat filtering

Assembly rules provide one possible unifying framework for community ecology. Given a species pool, and
measured traits for each species, the objective is to specify which traits (and therefore
which subset of species) will occur in a particular environment. Because the problem primarily involves traits and environments,
answers should be generalizable to systems with very different taxonomic composition.
In this context, the environment functions like a filter (or of sieve) removing all species lacking specified combinations traits. In this way, assembly rules are a community level analogue of natural selection. Response rules follow a similar process except that they transform a vector of species abundances to a new vector using the same information.
Examples already exist from a range of habitats, scales, and kinds of organisms},
